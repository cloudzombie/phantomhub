# Project Requirements Document (PRD) for O.MG Mission Control

## 1. Project Overview

O.MG Mission Control is a web-based dashboard designed to manage, deploy, and monitor O.MG Cable payloads in real time. The application provides an easy-to-use interface that integrates a powerful payload editor, real-time status monitoring, device management, and detailed result analysis. It is built to simplify and centralize the management of numerous O.MG Cables, eliminating the need for manual operations and command-line interactions. With a focus on enterprise use, it aims to deliver high-security, responsive control and comprehensive reporting.

The project is being built to offer a complete control hub for IT and security professionals who need to deploy and monitor complex payloads without juggling multiple tools. Key objectives include providing a secure deployment process, real-time updates using WebSockets, detailed audit trails, and robust error handling. Success will be measured by achieving a seamless, user-friendly payload crafting and deployment experience, with clear visibility into each device's status and reliable data capture for compliance and analysis.

## 2. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

**In-Scope:**

*   **User Authentication and Authorization:** Secure login with JWT or OAuth supporting three roles (Administrators, Operators, Viewers) with clear permission levels.
*   **Payload Editor:** An integrated code editor (using Monaco Editor) with DuckyScript syntax highlighting, autocompletion, live validation, error-checking, linting, and a library of reusable code snippets.
*   **Mission Dashboard:** Real-time status updates of O.MG Cables showing states such as "Connected," "Executing," and "Data Received" with interactive visualizations using Chart.js.
*   **Device Management:** Functionality to register and manage O.MG Cables via inputting Wi-Fi IP addresses or QR code pairing, displaying device info (IP, firmware version, last check-in).
*   **Results Viewer:** Display of returned data (e.g., system audits, keylogs) in a filterable, exportable table or grid (support for CSV and JSON formats).
*   **API Server/Back-End:** Node.js and Express API for payload deployment, device communication, logging, and data storage using Postgres with Sequelize.
*   **Real-Time Communication:** Integration of WebSockets for immediate updates from O.MG Cables.
*   **Error Handling & Logging:** Comprehensive error capture, real-time error notifications in the UI, and detailed audit logs for enterprise compliance.
*   **Third-Party Integrations:** SMS and email notifications using Twilio and SendGrid, along with potential webhook integration for services like Slack.
*   **Security Enhancements:** HTTPS with SSL/TLS for all communications, encryption of data at rest, and regular security audits.

**Out-of-Scope:**

*   **Desktop Application:** While an Electron-based version is mentioned for future consideration, the first version will focus solely on the web-based dashboard.
*   **Extensive Customization of Branding:** Basic modern, dark-themed UI with neon accents and standard sans-serif fonts (Roboto or Open Sans) will be used; no extensive branded assets or custom design guidelines are included.
*   **Complex Third-Party Integrations:** Beyond notifications (Twilio/SendGrid) and potential webhook support, advanced integrations with other enterprise systems are deferred to later phases.
*   **Non-Essential Features:** Advanced template libraries, deep analytics beyond exportable reports, and additional AI-driven code assistants (like Cursor) enhancements will be considered future improvements.

## 3. User Flow

A new user begins by accessing the PHANTOM HUB web-based login portal where they are required to securely authenticate. After successful login using JWT or OAuth, the user lands on a clean, modern dashboard designed in a dark theme with neon accents. The interface is customized based on the user’s role: Administrators see full controls including user management and audit logs; Operators access the Payload Editor, Mission Dashboard, and device management; and Viewers have read-only access to mission data and historical results.

Once inside the dashboard, the user navigates to the device management section to register new O.MG Cables by entering the device’s Wi-Fi IP or scanning a QR code. Next, in the Payload Editor, operators craft and test their DuckyScript payloads with real-time syntax checking and code suggestions. With a simple click, they deploy the payloads to selected cables. The Mission Dashboard then provides real-time updates via WebSockets, with charts and device statuses updating instantly. Finally, users can review exfiltrated data in the Results Viewer, filter and export the results for compliance or further analysis.

*   **Usability:**

    *   Modern, user-friendly UI with a high-contrast dark theme for easy readability
    *   Consistent and responsive design across devices (initially focused on desktop web)
    *   Easy navigation based on user roles and clear visual cues for actions and status

*   **Compliance:**

    *   Enterprise audit trails for all user actions (payload deployments, modifications)
    *   Comprehensive logging mechanisms to support detailed error reports and compliance audits

## 7. Constraints & Assumptions

*   **Constraints:**

    *   The application assumes availability and updated firmware support on O.MG Cables that allow HTTP communication for payload deployment and data exfiltration
    *   Scalability relies on the efficient configuration of Postgres and WebSocket servers; initially hosted on platforms like Heroku
    *   Real-time updates through WebSockets require reliable network conditions and proper error handling for intermittent connectivity

*   **Assumptions:**

    *   Users have basic technical proficiency and understand the context of payload deployment and analysis
    *   The chosen tech stack (React for front-end, Node.js/Express for back-end) will suffice for the project's scope and anticipated load
    *   Security standards like JWT/OAuth, SSL/TLS, and AES-256 are acceptable and up-to-date for enterprise requirements
    *   Third-party services (Twilio, SendGrid) are available and correctly configured for real-time notifications
    *   UI and UX decisions like dark themes and neon accents align with the ‘PHANTOM HUB’ branding and modern aesthetic

## 8. Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls

*   **Communication Challenges:**

    *   Ensuring seamless communication between the server and each O.MG Cable via HTTP endpoints may be prone to network failures. Consider robust retry logic and error handling during payload deployment.

*   **WebSocket Limitations:**

    *   Real-time updates via WebSocket can be affected by firewalls or NAT configurations in enterprise networks. A fallback mechanism (e.g., periodic polling) might be necessary in challenging network environments.

*   **API Rate Limits & Data Volume:**

    *   High volumes of payload requests or data exfiltration may lead to API rate limits or database performance issues. Scalability planning and possible horizontal scaling of the API server should be considered.

*   **Error Handling Complexity:**

    *   Capturing and logging errors at both the client and server sides requires careful implementation. Ensure that detailed logs (with timestamps, user IDs, and error descriptions) are consistently maintained without impacting performance.

*   **Security Vulnerabilities:**

    *   Given the sensitive nature of payloads and device control, vulnerabilities could have high impacts. Regular security audits, penetration testing, and adherence to best practices in encryption and data handling are essential.

*   **User Role Misconfigurations:**

    *   Mapping permissions incorrectly could lead to security lapses. The role-based access control must be thoroughly tested to ensure that Administrators, Operators, and Viewers have distinct, appropriate permissions with no overlaps leading to unauthorized changes.

This document is intended to serve as the central reference for the O.MG Mission Control project. It provides clear, unambiguous guidelines to ensure that every subsequent technical document—from the tech stack details to the frontend/back-end structure—can be generated with full understanding of the project’s goals and requirements.
