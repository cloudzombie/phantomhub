9. Create a login component at `/frontend/src/components/Login.js` that authenticates users using JWT. (Project Requirements: User Authentication)
10. Implement state management for authentication using React hooks or Redux (e.g., setting up `/frontend/src/store.js` if using Redux). (Project Requirements: User Authentication)
11. Create the Payload Editor page at `/frontend/src/pages/PayloadEditor.js` and integrate the Monaco Editor pre-configured for DuckyScript, including syntax highlighting, autocompletion, live validation, error checking, and linting. (Project Requirements: Payload Editor)
12. Develop a reusable code snippet library component within `/frontend/src/components/SnippetLibrary.js`. (Project Requirements: Payload Editor)
13. Create the Mission Dashboard page at `/frontend/src/pages/MissionDashboard.js` and integrate Chart.js to display interactive charts for real-time cable statuses ("Connected," "Executing," "Data Received"). (Project Requirements: Mission Dashboard)
14. Build the Device Management page at `/frontend/src/pages/DeviceManagement.js` to allow O.MG Cable registration via Wi-Fi IP input or QR code pairing; display IP, firmware version, and last check-in time. (Project Requirements: Device Management)
15. Develop the Results Viewer page at `/frontend/src/pages/ResultsViewer.js` featuring a filterable table/grid with CSV and JSON export options. (Project Requirements: Results Viewer)
16. Set up Axios service in `/frontend/src/services/api.js` to handle all API requests (login, payload deployment, etc.). (Project Requirements: Back-End API Integration)
17. Establish a WebSocket connection from the frontend by creating `/frontend/src/services/websocket.js` to receive real-time updates from the backend. (Project Requirements: Real-Time Communication)
18. **Validation:** Manually test UI components (login, payload editor, dashboard charts, device management, and data table) ensuring proper theming, routing, and data integration. (Project Requirements: UI/UX)

## Phase 3: Backend Development

19. Initialize a new Node.js project in `/backend` with `npm init` and install Express, Sequelize, PostgreSQL driver, JSON Web Token (JWT) libraries, and WebSocket libraries. (Tech Stack: Back-End)
20. Create the main server file at `/backend/server.js` to set up the Express application. (Project Requirements: Back-End API)
21. Configure environment variables (e.g., database credentials, JWT secret, Twilio, SendGrid keys) in a `.env` file in `/backend`. (Project Requirements: Security)
22. Set up Sequelize in `/backend/config/database.js` to connect to PostgreSQL and configure connection pooling, ensuring support for schema changes. (Project Requirements: Database)
23. Define Sequelize models for User, Payload, Device, MissionResult, and AuditLog in `/backend/models/` with proper fields for each entity. (Project Requirements: Database)
24. Develop authentication middleware in `/backend/middleware/auth.js` to validate JWT tokens or OAuth credentials and enforce role-based access (Administrators, Operators, Viewers). (Project Requirements: User Authentication)
25. Create an authentication endpoint at `/backend/routes/auth.js` for POST `/api/login` that returns a JWT upon successful login. (Project Requirements: User Authentication)
26. Build CRUD API endpoints for payload deployment at `/backend/routes/payloads.js` (e.g., POST `/api/payloads`), device management at `/backend/routes/devices.js`, and mission result retrieval at `/backend/routes/results.js`. (Project Requirements: Back-End API)
27. Set up comprehensive error handling and logging middleware in `/backend/middleware/errorHandler.js` to capture client- and server-side errors. (Project Requirements: Error Handling & Logging)
28. Integrate a WebSocket server in `/backend/websocket.js` to broadcast real-time updates (e.g., mission status, cable data) to connected clients. (Project Requirements: Real-Time Communication)
29. Implement audit logging in `/backend/services/auditLogger.js` to record critical user actions (payload deployment, device changes), ensuring enterprise-level audit capability. (Project Requirements: Audit Logging)
30. Develop integration modules for third-party services: create `/backend/services/twilio.js` for SMS notifications and `/backend/services/sendgrid.js` for email alerts. (Project Requirements: Third-Party Integrations)
31. **Validation:** Test each API endpoint and middleware using Postman or similar tools; for example, use POST requests to `/api/login` and ensure a valid JWT is returned and error cases are handled. (Project Requirements: Testing & Security)

## Phase 4: Integration

32. Connect the frontend login component to the backend authentication endpoint using the Axios service (`POST /api/login`). (Project Requirements: User Authentication)
33. Wire the Payload Editor form to the `/api/payloads` endpoint via Axios for payload deployment. (Project Requirements: Payload Editor)
34. Integrate device management functions in the frontend with corresponding endpoints in `/api/devices` using Axios. (Project Requirements: Device Management)
35. Link the Results Viewer component to the `/api/results` endpoint so that mission data is retrieved and filterable in the UI. (Project Requirements: Results Viewer)
36. Establish and test the WebSocket connection from the frontend with the backend WebSocket server for real-time updates. (Project Requirements: Real-Time Communication)
37. Implement centralized error notifications in the frontend to display messages for failed API requests or WebSocket disconnections. (Project Requirements: Error Handling)
38. **Validation:** Simulate end-to-end flows (login, payload deployment, device registration) and verify that UI and backend communicate correctly with proper error handling. (Project Requirements: Integration Testing)

## Phase 5: Deployment

39. Create a `Procfile` at the project root to define the Heroku process type for the backend. (Project Requirements: Deployment)
40. Configure the build and start scripts in the `package.json` for both `/frontend` and `/backend` to support Heroku deployment. (Project Requirements: Deployment)
41. Set up GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines to build, test, and deploy the application to Heroku automatically upon code push. (Project Requirements: CI/CD)
42. Configure environment variables (database credentials, JWT secrets, Twilio/SendGrid API keys) on Heroku. (Project Requirements: Security)
43. Deploy the backend and frontend to Heroku and perform post-deployment tests using the integrated CI/CD pipeline. (Project Requirements: Deployment)
44. **Validation:** Run end-to-end tests in the production environment (simulate login, payload submission, and real-time updates) to ensure all critical features and security requirements are met. (Project Requirements: Pre-Launch Checklist)
