# Tech Stack Document

This document explains the set of technologies chosen for the O.MG Mission Control project in everyday language, ensuring you understand why each component is used and how it all comes together to create a robust, user-friendly dashboard. Below, you’ll find details organized by the major parts of the project:

## Frontend Technologies

The frontend is where users interact with the application. It is designed to be modern, responsive, and easy to use. Here are the key technologies and why they were chosen:

- **React**
  - A popular JavaScript framework that enables the creation of dynamic and efficient user interfaces. It's used to build the overall structure and interactivity of the dashboard.
  - Integrates well with tools that manage state (using React Hooks or Redux) to keep user interactions smooth and predictable.

- **Monaco Editor**
  - This is the same editor used in Visual Studio Code. It powers the Payload Editor, offering features like DuckyScript syntax highlighting, autocompletion, live validation, and error checking. This makes coding payloads as intuitive as writing in a modern IDE.

- **Material-UI or Tailwind CSS**
  - These styling tools help in designing a sleek, professional, dark-themed interface with vibrant neon accents (such as electric blue or neon green) that align with the PHANTOM HUB branding. They ensure consistent design and easy customization of the user interface.

- **Axios**
  - A reliable library used to handle API calls. It facilitates smooth communication between the frontend and backend, ensuring that data flows seamlessly even when the application is interacting with devices and updating in real-time.

- **Chart.js**
  - Used to visualize data on the Mission Dashboard. It creates interactive charts that help operators quickly understand the status and performance of payload deployments and device communications.

- **Cursor (Advanced IDE integration)**
  - Provides AI-driven coding support with real-time suggestions within the code editor. It assists users by offering code improvements and helpful hints during script creation.

## Backend Technologies

Behind the scenes, the backend is responsible for processing data, handling communication with devices, and ensuring the application runs smoothly. Key components include:

- **Node.js with Express**
  - Node.js is a powerful server-side JavaScript platform. Express is a framework for building web servers. Together, they form the core of the API server that handles payload deployment, device registration, and real-time updates.

- **Postgres**
  - A robust and scalable relational database that stores device metadata, payload scripts, and mission results. It is chosen for its ability to handle complex queries and its flexibility in evolving database schemas as the project grows.

- **Sequelize (ORM)**
  - This Object-Relational Mapping tool simplifies database interactions, making it easier for developers to work with Postgres without writing complex SQL queries.

- **WebSocket**
  - Provides real-time communication between the server and connected devices (O.MG Cables). It ensures that any change in device status or payload execution is immediately reflected on the Mission Dashboard.

- **JWT / OAuth**
  - These authentication methods secure the backend by ensuring that only authorized users can access sensitive functionalities. They are key to implementing the role-based access control system for Administrators, Operators, and Viewers.

## Infrastructure and Deployment

To ensure the project is reliable, scalable, and easy to deploy, the following strategies and tools are used in the infrastructure:

- **Hosting Platforms (e.g., Heroku)**
  - The backend (Node.js/Express) and frontend (React app) are ideally hosted on platforms like Heroku, making deployment straightforward and allowing for easy scaling as usage increases.

- **CI/CD Pipelines**
  - Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment practices are established to ensure that every change in the code is automatically tested and deployed. This keeps the application stable and reduces downtime.

- **Version Control (e.g., Git)**
  - A version control system is used to track changes, collaborate among team members, and maintain historical records of the project’s evolution. This ensures that rolling back to a stable version is always an option if needed.

## Third-Party Integrations

The project leverages several external services to enhance its capabilities and streamline operations:

- **Twilio**
  - Integrated for sending SMS notifications, helping alert users instantly in case of errors, deployment issues, or important mission updates.

- **SendGrid**
  - Used for email notifications to keep users informed about key events, like successful payload deployments or system alerts.

- **Webhooks (e.g., Slack, Pushbullet)**
  - Optional integrations can be set up to send alerts to platforms like Slack, providing team collaboration features and ensuring that real-time insights are shared across the organization.

## Security and Performance Considerations

Security and performance are critical for this project, given that it deals with real-time operations and sensitive data. Here’s what has been implemented:

- **User Authentication & Authorization**
  - With either JWT or OAuth serving as the gatekeeper, every user is authenticated, and only authorized operators are allowed to deploy payloads. This ensures that sensitive operations are restricted to verified personnel.

- **Data Encryption**
  - HTTPS with SSL/TLS is employed to secure all data transmitted between the client, server, and O.MG Cables.
  - At rest, sensitive data such as payload scripts and mission results are protected using strong encryption standards (like AES-256).

- **Real-Time Error Handling and Logging**
  - Both the frontend and backend are equipped with detailed error handling to catch issues such as connection timeouts or failed deployments. Users receive immediate notifications if something goes wrong.
  - Comprehensive logging mechanisms not only help in troubleshooting but also maintain enterprise audit trails, capturing who did what and when – a must for compliance.

- **Performance Optimizations**
  - The use of WebSockets guarantees that updates from O.MG Cables reach users as soon as they occur, eliminating the costly delays inherent in repetitive HTTP polling.
  - Modern, efficient libraries and a well-structured API design contribute to a fast, responsive user experience, while tools like Chart.js handle real-time data visualization smoothly.

## Conclusion and Overall Tech Stack Summary
