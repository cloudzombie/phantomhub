# Real Device Management Implementation Plan

This document outlines the plan to implement real device management functionality with proper user-based information storage in the database.

## 1. Current State Analysis

**Database Models:**
- Models already exist for: User, Device, Payload, Deployment, UserSettings
- Relations are established between models:
  - User owns Devices, Payloads, Deployments, and has UserSettings
  - Device connects to Deployments
  - Payload connects to Deployments
  - Deployment links User + Device + Payload

**Authentication & Authorization:**
- JWT-based authentication system implemented
- Role-based access control with roles: Administrator, Operator, Viewer
- Protected routes with middleware checks (authenticate, isOperator)

**Front-end Components:**
- Dashboard with device status display
- Device Management page for adding/managing devices
- Web Serial API utilities for USB device communication

## 4. O.MG Cable Protocol Details

### DuckyScript Implementation
1. **Payload Execution Language**:
   - O.MG Elite Cable uses DuckyScript as its primary communication language for executing payloads
   - DuckyScript enables keystroke injection attacks (simulating keyboard inputs on target devices)
   - The Elite model supports speeds up to 890 keys per second
   
2. **DuckyScript Commands**:
   - Simple, human-readable syntax resembling keyboard commands
   - Includes delays, special keys (ENTER, CTRL, etc.), and text strings
   - Example payload actions: opening terminals, typing commands, executing programs
   
3. **Payload Development**:
   - Web-based interface for writing and deploying scripts directly
   - No recompilation or reprogramming required for payload updates
   - Our application should support creating, editing, and deploying DuckyScript payloads

### Hardware Communication
1. **USB Interface**:
   - O.MG Cable presents itself as a USB HID (Human Interface Device)
   - Does not use traditional serial communication for the attack vector
   - Delivers payloads via USB HID reports that mimic keystrokes
   
2. **Serial/Debug Connections**:
   - During firmware updates or advanced configuration, serial connections may be used
   - The microcontroller (likely ESP8266 or similar) has UART pins that support serial communication
   - Serial interfaces (via USB-to-serial) might be used when flashing firmware
   - Typical baud rate: 115200
   
3. **Wi-Fi Capabilities**:
   - Built-in Wi-Fi module for remote command-and-control
   - Web UI accessible at 192.168.4.1 when in access point mode
   - Uses HTTP for web interface and can establish encrypted tunnels for remote control
   - Uses standard networking protocols (TCP/IP) over Wi-Fi

### Integration Requirements
1. **WebSerial API Implementation**:
   - Our WebSerial implementation must handle the correct USB HID protocol
   - Needs proper error handling for connection issues
   - Should support firmware version detection and updates
