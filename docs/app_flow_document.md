# O.MG Mission Control App Flow Document

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up
When a brand-new user first accesses PHANTOM HUB, they are greeted by a sleek landing page that clearly reflects the modern, dark-themed design with neon accents. The landing page provides an introduction to the application, highlighting its capabilities to create, deploy, and monitor O.MG Cable payloads in real time. Users can choose to sign up using secure methods such as email registration or social login. The sign-up process is simple and straightforward, requiring verification of their identity and setting up a secure password. In addition, users who already have an account are presented with a clear sign-in page that supports secure authentication methods using JWT or OAuth. There is also a well-defined flow for forgotten passwords where users can initiate a recovery process by providing their email address, receiving a recovery link, and resetting their password. Once signed in, users have the option to sign out at any time through an easily accessible logout function in the application header.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page
After successfully logging in, users land on the main dashboard. This is the heart of PHANTOM HUB, a centralized interface that aligns with the user's role. Administrators see full system controls such as user management, audit logs, and device oversight. Operators are presented with essential tools such as the Payload Editor, Mission Dashboard, and Device Management sections, while Viewers are provided with a read-only view of real-time mission data and historical logs. The main dashboard is structured with a clear header that contains navigation options, a sidebar that provides quick access to different modules, and central panels that display live data, charts, and status updates. Navigation between these sections is designed to be intuitive; users can switch from monitoring missions to deploying payloads with just a few clicks, ensuring that the entire application flow remains seamless and connected.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions
Once inside the main dashboard, users can initiate different core workflows based on their roles. When an Operator navigates to the device management section, they will find a simple registration process where they can add new O.MG Cables by entering a device’s Wi-Fi IP address or by scanning a QR code. Upon registration, the system updates the device list, showing details like the cable’s IP, firmware version, and the last check-in time, which is essential for monitoring connectivity and readiness.

Moving deeper into the workflow, the Payload Editor is accessed from the main dashboard. This page houses a robust code editor powered by the Monaco Editor. Here, users can craft DuckyScript payloads with helpful features like syntax highlighting, autocompletion, live validation, and error-checking. This page also offers access to a library of reusable code snippets and templates to streamline the payload creation process. Once the payload is crafted and saved, the deployment process is as simple as clicking a deploy button. At that point the payload is securely saved to the database and dispatched to the chosen O.MG Cables through a backend API that communicates using secure HTTP endpoints.

After deploying a payload, users are automatically transitioned to the Mission Dashboard where real-time updates of the payload execution are displayed. This page utilizes WebSocket integration for pushing live updates, meaning that the user sees immediate status changes such as ‘Connected’, ‘Executing’, or ‘Data Received’. Interactive charts built using Chart.js dynamically update to present progress and analytics from the ongoing mission. This monitoring page is tightly integrated with the rest of the application and allows operators to see the results of their deployments in real time. For detailed analysis, operators and viewers can navigate to the Results Viewer where exfiltrated data is presented in a filterable table or grid. This section supports export options such as CSV and JSON to facilitate compliance reporting and further analysis.

Beyond these core flows, the application offers advanced workflows for administrators. In addition to overseeing all payload deployments and device statuses, administrators have dedicated pages to manage user accounts, configure system settings, and review detailed audit trails. These audit logs capture every significant event such as payload deployments, modifications, or error occurrences. Each of these views is interconnected and users can easily move back to the main dashboard without losing context.

## Settings and Account Management
Users wishing to manage their personal settings can access the account management page from a clearly marked option in the header or sidebar. This page allows users to update personal information, change passwords, and set preferences such as notification settings. In cases where billing or subscription management is necessary, an additional secure billing settings area may be incorporated, though primary functionality focuses on operational management. Once changes are saved, users are returned to the main application interface seamlessly, ensuring that the overall experience remains uninterrupted and integrated with all other functions.

## Error States and Alternate Paths
The application is designed with robustness in mind, so if a user inputs invalid data or encounters a connectivity issue, they are provided with clear and helpful error messages. For example, if an invalid IP address is entered during device registration or if a deployment command fails due to a network timeout, the error is immediately displayed on the same page with suggestions for corrective actions. The Payload Editor includes inline error notifications for syntax mistakes, and each API request includes fallback error handling mechanisms. In cases where the WebSocket connection drops, the system alerts the user via notifications, and a fallback polling mechanism is in place to attempt reconnection. Every error is logged with details such as timestamps, user actions, and error descriptions so that administrators can review these logs later to maintain enterprise-grade audit trails.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey
The overall journey in PHANTOM HUB starts when users discover the application through a sleek landing page and proceed with a secure sign-up or sign-in process. Once authenticated, they are welcomed into a role-based, modern dashboard that serves as the control center for all O.MG Cable operations. Whether registering new devices, crafting payloads in an advanced code editor, deploying those payloads with a single click, or monitoring real-time mission progress via interactive charts and detailed logs, each step is designed for ease of use and security. The continuous flow from device management to payload deployment and real-time monitoring, along with comprehensive settings and robust error handling, ensures that every user – be they an Administrator, Operator, or Viewer – has a clear, connected, and efficient experience. The journey rounds off with detailed audit logging and secure data management, creating a reliable platform that meets both operational needs and compliance standards for enterprise users.
